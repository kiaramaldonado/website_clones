## 1. Winery Landing Page Clone

This clone replicates the landing page of a modern winery website from [Elegant Themes](https://www.elegantthemes.com/). It showcases a sleek design with elegant typography, rich imagery, and responsive features that adapt seamlessly to any screen size. My version stays fairly true to the original layout and aesthetics with some minor adjustments, as this was a task to complete for a class.

## 2. Software Home Page Clone

This clone replicates the homepage of a modern software website inspired by a professional design. It features a minimalist aesthetic, clean layout, sophisticated typography, and strategically organized sections to highlight key product features. My version stays true to the original design with minor adjustments to enhance the user experience.
