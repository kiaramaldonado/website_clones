### _Enjoy!_

## 1. Winery Landing Page Clone

This clone replicates the landing page of a modern winery website from [Elegant Themes](https://www.elegantthemes.com/). It showcases a sleek design with elegant typography, rich imagery, and responsive features that adapt seamlessly to any screen size. My version stays fairly true to the original layout and aesthetics with some minor adjustments, as this was a task to complete for a class.
